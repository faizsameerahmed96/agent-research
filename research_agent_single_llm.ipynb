      "General elections were held in India from 19 April to 1 June 2024 in seven phases, to elect all 543 members of the Lok Sabha.[a] Votes were counted and the result was declared on 4 June to form the 18th Lok Sabha.[2][3] On 7 June 2024, Prime Minister Narendra Modi confirmed the support of 293 MPs to Droupadi Murmu, the president of India.[4] This marked Modi's third term as prime minister and his first time heading a coalition government,[5] with the Telugu Desam Party of Andhra Pradesh and Janata Dal (United) of Bihar emerging as two main allies.[6][7][8]\n",
      "More than 968 million people out of a population of 1.4 billion people were eligible to vote, equivalent to 70 percent of the total population.[9][10][11] 642 million voters participated in the election and 312 million of them were women, making it the highest ever participation by women voters.[12][13] This was the largest-ever election, surpassing the previous election, and lasted 44 days, second only to the 1951–52 Indian general election.  The legislative assembly elections in the states of Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Odisha, and Sikkim were held simultaneously with the general election, along with the by-elections for 25 constituencies in 12 legislative assemblies.\n",
      "Incumbent prime minister Narendra Modi, who completed a second term, ran for a third consecutive term after his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) had enjoyed an absolute majority—a minimum of 272 seats—in the 2019 and 2014 elections. The primary opposition was the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (INDIA), a coalition formed by the Indian National Congress (INC) and many regional parties in 2023. The election was criticised for lack of action on hate speeches by Modi's BJP,[14] reported electronic voting machine (EVM) malfunctioning,[15][16] and suppression of political opponents of the BJP.[17]\n",
      "Opinion surveys of mainstream media outlets projected a decisive victory for the BJP and its coalition, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA). However, the BJP won 240 seats, down from the 303 seats it had secured in 2019, and lost its singular majority in the Lok Sabha, whereas the overall NDA secured 293 of the house's 543 seats.[18] The INDIA coalition outperformed expectations, securing 234 seats, 99 of which were won by the Congress, garnering the party the official opposition status for the first time in 10 years.[19][20][21] Seven independents and ten candidates from non-aligned parties also won seats in the Lok Sabha.[22][23][24]\n",
      "\n",

      "Background\n",
      "Contemporary politics and previous elections\n",
      "India has a multi-party system with two major parties, namely the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Indian National Congress (INC), that dominate politics at the national level. The BJP has governed the country with Narendra Modi at the helm since 2014. The tenure of the 17th Lok Sabha is scheduled to end on 16 June 2024.[25] The previous general election was held in April–May 2019, after which the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), led by the BJP, formed the union government, with Modi continuing as Prime Minister.[26] The Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance, comprising of 26 opposition parties, was formed in 2023 to contest against the NDA in the elections.[27]\n",

      "Electoral system\n",
      "Main article: Elections in India\n",
      "Chief Election Commissioner Rajiv Kumar announced the schedule for the elections on 16 March 2024 \n",
      "Article 83 of the Constitution of India requires elections to the Lok Sabha to be held once every five years.[28] The 543 MPs are elected from single-member constituencies using first-past-the-post voting.[29] The 104th amendment to the constitution abolished the two seats that were reserved for the Anglo-Indian community.[30]\n",
      "Indian citizens who are 18 years or older, ordinary residents of the polling area of the constituency and registered to vote (name included in the electoral rolls), possess a valid voter identification card issued by the Election Commission of India or equivalent are eligible to vote.[31] People convicted of electoral or other offenses and prisoners, are barred from voting.[32] Indians holding foreign citizenship are not eligible to vote in India. There is no postal or online absentee voting in India; members of the Indian diaspora are required to travel back to their home constituencies in order to cast a ballot.[33]\n",
      "For the 2024 election, 968 million people were eligible to vote, an increase of about 150 million people from the 2019 election.[34] In Arunachal Pradesh, a polling station will be set up for the only registered voter in the village of Malogam, as electoral laws stipulate that voting booths need to be within two kilometres (1.2 mi) from any settlement.[35][36] A polling station was also set up inside the Gir Forest in Gujarat to cater for a single voter, a priest at a Hindu temple.[37] Polling stations were also set up inside a wildlife sanctuary in Kerala, in a shipping container in Gujarat, and 320 relief camps hosting nearly 59,000 people displaced during violence in Manipur.[38][39]\n",
      "In March 2024, the Supreme Court of India rejected a petition by the Congress party to end the usage of electronic voting machines (EVMs) and revert to paper ballots and manual counting, which was the system used in elections until the late 1990s, with the party citing risks of electoral fraud.[40] Nearly 5.5 million EVMs were utilized in more than one million polling stations with 15 million election workers and security personnel tasked with managing the conduct of the election.[41]\n",
      "For the first time, the Election Commission of India allowed voters with disabilities and those over the age of 85 to cast ballots from their homes.[42] In Telangana, voting in some areas was extended by an hour more to allow voters to come at a more convenient time.[43]\n",
      "\n",
      "Planning\n",
      "Key processes during a Lok Sabha election involved monitoring campaign expenditure, preventing the circulation of illicit goods, and ensuring adherence to the Model Code of Conduct. In the final 48 hours before voting, campaigns are ceased, and measures are implemented to maintain order and prevent disruptions. On polling day, strict rules are enforced to prevent undue influence and ensure a secure and free election process. After the elections, EVMs are sealed and stored under tight security with Booth Level Officers assisting throughout the process.[44]\n",

After the consecration of the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya, a new era of Hindu nationalistic sentiments have dominated the political sphere in India.[88][89] Modi kept a long-standing political pledge of the reconstruction of the Ram Mandir and was seen to have fulfilled the BJP's manifesto to the nation's Hindu population.[89] The Hindu nationalist ideology of Modi and the BJP has also garnered substantial support from Hindu community members.[90][91] At the same time, Bollywood productions have been released with themes supporting the Modi government's policies and Hindu nationalist ideologies.[92] In response to such concerns, BJP spokesperson Mmhonlumo Kikon acknowledged the existence of a \"level of threat perception\", but said that the party was trying to change that.[93]\n",
      "A major controversy was stirred when the opposition Congress Party and its leaders declined an invitation to the Ram Mandir consecration ceremony, saying that the event was politicised into a 'BJP-RSS event'.[94] Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said that the invitation was an opportunity for the Congress to 'reduce its sin', and that history would continue to judge it as 'anti-Hindu'.[95] The four Shankaracharyas also declined attending the event, stating that the ceremony was politicised as a campaign event at the half-built temple.[96][97]\n",
      "During a campaign rally in Rajasthan on 21 April, Narendra Modi accused the Congress party of prioritizing Muslim access to national wealth and planning to distribute resources among \"those who have more children\" and \"infiltrators\" once it was in power, which reflected stereotypes about Muslims reproducing in greater numbers and conspiracy theories pushed by the BJP that Muslims were planning to outnumber Hindus. Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge called Modi's remarks a panic-filled \"hate speech\" and a ploy to divert attention from the opposition outperforming the BJP during the first phase of the election, while officials in Rajasthan received complaints from the Azad Adhikar Sena and a non-profit organisation demanding Modi's arrest and for his campaign to be suspended.[98][99]\n",

      "Electoral Bonds\n",
      "On 15 February 2024, the Supreme Court of India ruled that the Electoral Bond system of campaign financing that was introduced by the Modi government in 2017 which allowed individuals and companies to donate money to political parties anonymously and without limits was unconstitutional, saying that the process allowed donors to assert \"influence over policymaking\".[102] On 18 March, the court ordered the State Bank of India (SBI) to provide all records regarding the electoral bonds to the Election Commission of India by 21 March in order to match electoral donors with their recipients and rejected a plea by the Confederation of Indian Industry, the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry, and the Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India from divulging the identities of donors. Initial reports suggest that among the leading donors to political parties were some of India's largest firms such as Vedanta Limited, Bharti Airtel, RPSG Group and Essel Mining. It also found that the BJP was the recipient of nearly half of all recorded donations.[103]\n",
      "In total, the top five political parties in terms of electoral bonds received are the BJP, which received Rs 6,060.5 crore, the All India Trinamool Congress (TMC), which received Rs 1,609.5 crore, the Congress Party, with Rs 1,421.8 crore, the Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS), which received Rs 1,214.7 crore, and the Biju Janata Dal (BJD), which received Rs 775.5 crore.[104][105][106] The biggest buyer of electoral bonds was found to be Santiago Martin, the Tamil Nadu-based head of the lottery firm Future Gaming and Hotel Services Private Limited, who bought bonds worth 13.68 billion rupees ($163 million) between 2020 and 2024 and made donations to the TMC, the BJP, and the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), which rules Tamil Nadu. The biggest single donor to any political party was Megha Engineering and Infrastructure Limited (MEIL), a construction firm based in Hyderabad that bought electoral bonds worth over 12 billion rupees ($144 million) between 2019 and 2024 and made donations to the Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS), the BJP, and the Congress Party, who alternated in ruling Telangana during that time.[107]\n",
      "Some politicians from the opposition have termed Electoral Bonds a \"scam\" and an \"extortion racket\".[108][109][110] In response to allegations regarding the electoral bonds, BJP spokesperson Syed Zafar Islam denied that the party had done any wrongdoing and said that its electoral bonds were gained \"on merit\".[107] However, Indian political observers have reached the conclusion that either Indian businessmen have been regularly bribing their way out of trouble, or that the BJP-controlled government has been using government agencies to extort them. From the data released by the SBI, it was found that companies gave donations around the time they received major government contracts. Close to half of the top 30 corporate donors were facing investigations by government agencies around the time they purchased electoral bonds.[111][112][113]\n",

After being flagged by multiple users, the video was taken down less than 24 hours after its publication.[126] A similar video posted on X towards voters in Karnataka was also ordered taken down by the Electoral Commission and led to police opening cases against senior BJP leaders.[127]\n",

The party's leader Rahul Gandhi complained that the restrictions had rendered the party unable to campaign properly, adding that \"Our entire financial identity has been erased.\" Gandhi also accused Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah of conducting a \"criminal action\" against the party, which the BJP denied.

      "The Rashtriya Janata Dal began its campaign with its Jan Vishwas Yatra (\"People's Trust Yatra\") on 20 February 2024. RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav launched the yatra from Muzaffarpur in Bihar. The yatra lasted until 1 March 2024 and covered 33 districts.[161][162] In Siwan on 23 February, Yadav termed the BJP \"a dustbin\" which takes in other parties that have become \"garbage\".[163][164]\n",

The Enforcement Directorate is also investigating four chief ministers not allied with the BJP on various charges, while investigations have been closed on former opposition politicians who have since joined the BJP. Hartosh Singh Bal, a journalist for the current affairs magazine The Caravan told Agence France-Presse that the move by government agencies indicated their behavior as \"handmaidens of the ruling party to cow down the political opposition\".[156]\n",
      "Following Kejriwal's arrest on 21 March over the liquor license scam charges, Delhi's finance minister Atishi Marlena Singh accused the BJP of orchestrating a \"political conspiracy\" against Kejriwal.[165] His arrest also led to clashes between party leaders, supporters and the police on 22 March.[166] Rahul Gandhi, reacting to Kejriwal's arrest, said that a \"scared dictator\" wants to create a \"dead democracy\", without naming anyone.[167] After he was released on bail and allowed to vote, Kejriwal urged citizens to vote \"vote against dictatorship\".[168] He then returned to prison as part of his bail conditions.[169]\n",
      "The BJP-led government has been known to use Enforcement Directorate raids to target opposition politicians critical of it, with 95% of cases registered being against opposition leaders.[170][171][172] Since 2014, 25 opposition leaders facing corruption charges have joined the BJP, with 23 of them having their inquiries closed or frozen after joining the ruling party.[173] This has led the Congress Party to compare the trend to a \"washing machine\" in one of its campaign videos.[126]\n",

Narendra Modi, India’s prime minister, claimed victory, after his Bharatiya Janata Party and its allies won 292 seats in the Lok Sabha, the lower house of Parliament (272 are needed to form a government). The opposition alliance led by the Congress party won 234 seats. The results are a humbling for Mr Modi.  Exit polls suggested the BJP would sweep the elections and Mr Modi’s alliance had set a target of winning 400 seats, after winning 353 in the election in 2019. The chart above shows the seat count by party, and the map at the bottom of this page shows the result in each seat.If you are interested in contests elsewhere, see our Trump/Biden poll tracker, our British election tracker and more at our election tracker hub.Indian elections take place over seven phases. They are staggered, such that a week or so passes between each round, and scattered all over the country, in a splotchy-looking map that the Election Commission of India has calibrated carefully. And no one will know who won any given seat until the results are announced on June 4th. Why draw out the voting like this? Getting from one part of the country to another takes time; some of India’s more than 1m polling stations are still extremely remote. A roving company of administrators, backed up by an enormous number of police and paramilitary forces, try to ensure a free and fair election. In wilder times the Election Commission was chiefly concerned with protecting ballot boxes from being stuffed or stolen, or candidates kidnapped. Today it is more focused on organising a fair and well-publicised vote.  Indian election 2024, voting phases Apr 14th May 7th 26th 13th 25th Jun 1st May 20th  Ahead of the election, the outcome was in little doubt: Mr Modi’s BJP was strongly favoured to return to power. Over the past 40 years, when the party first contested an election, it has come to dominate national politics. Just as striking as the BJP’s rise is Congress’s fall. The only previous time a party has broken the 400-seat mark in the Lok Sabha was in 1984, when Congress was propelled by a wave of sympathy after the assassination of Indira Gandhi, the prime minister, in October that year. That helped it win nearly half of the vote. This year it may struggle to win more than a fifth. To put up a stronger fight, it has teamed up with more than 30 other parties in the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (INDIA).Read more of our coverage of the Indian election, or sign up to Essential India, our free weekly newsletter.For the opposition, the proposition of toppling the BJP may seem daunting. The ruling party’s strongholds are the north and west, India’s Hindi-speaking heartlands, where its Hindu-nationalist populism has proven popular. The approach has had far less resonance in the richer south, where the BJP has struggled against stronger regional competitors. There is also more hope for the opposition at the state level. The BJP holds only around a third of India’s more than 4,000 state assembly seats. It has suffered defeats to smaller, regional parties, including in Andhra Pradesh and Odisha, which have also gone to the polls in the past month.We will populate the map below with the latest results, seat by seat, once they are declared.  ■Winning party in each seat  BJP  Allies  Congress   Allies   Other    \n",

Seats needed for majority     N.D.A.  293 seats won   Other  16 won   INDIA  234 won  Modi’s B.J.P. and allies Congress and allies The results indicated that Mr. Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party, or B.J.P., would still win by far the most parliamentary seats, and that he would become only the second Indian leader to start a third straight term.But his party appeared likely to lose a significant number of seats in Parliament, meaning it would need to rely on smaller parties in its coalition to form a government. The outcome was a surprising setback for the B.J.P.

      "NEW DELHI (AP) — Prime Minister Narendra Modi declared victory for his alliance in India’s general election, claiming a mandate to move forward with his agenda, even though his party lost seats to a stronger than expected opposition, which pushed back against his mixed economic record and polarizing politics.“Today’s victory is the victory of the world’s largest democracy,” Modi told the crowd at his party’s headquarters Tuesday, saying Indian voters had “shown immense faith” both in his party and his National Democratic Alliance coalition. \n",

      "Official results from India’s Election Commission on Wednesday showed the NDA won 294 seats, more than the 272 seats needed to secure a majority but far fewer than had been expected.For the first time since his Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party swept to power in 2014, it did not secure a majority on its own, winning 240 seats — far fewer than the record 303 it won in the 2019 election. \n",
      "\n",
      "That means Modi will need the support of other parties in his coalition — a stunning blow for the 73-year-old, who had hoped for a landslide victory. During campaigning, Modi said his party would likely win 370 seats and his allies another 30 seats. \n",

      "More than 640 million votes were cast in the marathon election held over a span of six weeks in the world’s largest democratic exercise. In the face of the surprising drop in the BJP’s support, challengers claimed they had also won a victory of sorts, with the main opposition Congress party saying the election had been a “moral and political loss” for Modi.\n",

      "“This is public’s victory and a win for democracy,” Congress party President Mallikarjun Kharge told reporters.Despite the setback, Modi pledged to make good on his election promise to turn India’s economy into the world’s third biggest, from its current fifth place, and not shirk with pushing forward with his agenda.He said he would advance India’s defense production, boost jobs for youth, raise exports and help farmers, among other things.“This country will see a new chapter of big decisions. This is Modi’s guarantee,” he said, speaking in the third person.Many of the Hindu nationalist policies he’s instituted over the last 10 years will also remain locked in place.Modi’s win was only the second time an Indian leader has retained power for a third term after Jawaharlal Nehru, the country’s first prime minister. Before Modi came to power, India had coalition governments for 30 years.Congratulations for Modi from leaders of regional countries including neighboring Nepal and Bhutan flowed in, while the White House commended India for its “vibrant democratic process.” \n",
      "\n",
      "In his 10 years in power, Modi has transformed India’s political landscape, bringing Hindu nationalism, once a fringe ideology in India, into the mainstream while leaving the country deeply divided. His supporters see him as a self-made, strong leader who has improved India’s standing in the world. His critics and opponents say his Hindu-first politics have bred intolerance while the economy, one of the world’s fastest-growing, has become more unequal.For Payal, a resident of the northern city of Lucknow who uses only one name, the election was about the economy and India’s vast number of people living in poverty.“People are suffering, there are no jobs, people are in such a state that their kids are compelled to make and sell tea on the roadside,” Payal said. “This is a big deal for us. If we don’t wake up now, when will we?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Rahul Gandhi, the main face of the opposition Congress party, said he saw the election numbers as a message from the people. “The poorest of this country have defended the constitution of India,” he told a news conference.Modi’s popularity has outstripped that of his party’s during his first two terms in office, and he turned the parliamentary election into one that more resembled a presidential-style campaign, with the BJP relying on the leader’s brand. “Modi was not just the prime campaigner, but the sole campaigner of this election,” said Yamini Aiyar, a public policy scholar. Under Modi’s government, critics say India’s democracy has come under increasing strain with strong-arm tactics used to subdue political opponents, squeeze independent media and quash dissent. The government has rejected such accusations and says democracy is flourishing.Economic discontent has also simmered under Modi. While stock markets have reached record-highs, youth unemployment has soared, with only a small portion of Indians benefitting from the boom.As polls opened in mid-April, a confident BJP initially focused its campaign on “Modi’s guarantees,” highlighting the economic and welfare achievements that his party says have reduced poverty. With Modi at the helm, “India will become a developed nation by 2047,” he repeated in rally after rally.But the campaign turned increasingly shrill, as Modi ramped up polarizing rhetoric that targeted Muslims, who make up 14% of the population, a tactic seen to energize his core Hindu majority voters.The opposition INDIA alliance attacked Modi over his Hindu nationalist politics, and campaigned on issues of joblessness, inflation and inequality. “These issues have resonated and made a dent,” added Aiyar, the public policy scholar. \n",
