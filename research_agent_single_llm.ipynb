Narendra Modi , India’s prime minister, claimed victory, after his Bharatiya Janata Party and its allies won 292 seats in the Lok Sabha, the lower house of Parliament (272 are needed to form a government). The opposition alliance led by the Congress party won 234 seats. The results are a humbling for Mr Modi . Exit polls suggested the BJP would sweep the elections and Mr Modi’s alliance had set a target of winning 400 seats, after winning 353 in the election in 2019. The chart above shows the seat count by party, and the map at the bottom of this page shows the result in each seat. If you are interested in contests elsewhere, see our Trump/Biden poll tracker, our British election tracker and more at our election tracker hub . Indian elections take place over seven phases. They are staggered, such that a week or so passes between each round, and scattered all over the country, in a splotchy-looking map that the Election Commission of India has calibrated carefully. And no one will know who won any given seat until the results are announced on June 4th. Why draw out the voting like this? Getting from one part of the country to another takes time; some of India’s more than 1m polling stations are still extremely remote. A roving company of administrators, backed up by an enormous number of police and paramilitary forces, try to ensure a free and fair election. In wilder times the Election Commission was chiefly concerned with protecting ballot boxes from being stuffed or stolen, or candidates kidnapped. Today it is more focused on organising a fair and well-publicised vote. Indian election 2024, voting phases Apr 14th May 7th 26th 13th 25th Jun 1st May 20th Ahead of the election, the outcome was in little doubt: Mr Modi’s BJP was strongly favoured to return to power. Over the past 40 years, when the party first contested an election, it has come to dominate national politics. Just as striking as the BJP ’s rise is Congress’s fall. The only previous time a party has broken the 400-seat mark in the Lok Sabha was in 1984, when Congress was propelled by a wave of sympathy after the assassination of Indira Gandhi, the prime minister, in October that year. That helped it win nearly half of the vote. This year it may struggle to win more than a fifth. To put up a stronger fight, it has teamed up with more than 30 other parties in the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance ( INDIA ).

The ruling party’s strongholds are the north and west, India’s Hindi-speaking heartlands, where its Hindu-nationalist populism has proven popular. The approach has had far less resonance in the richer south, where the BJP has struggled against stronger regional competitors. There is also more hope for the opposition at the state level. The BJP holds only around a third of India’s more than 4,000 state assembly seats. It has suffered defeats to smaller, regional parties, including in Andhra Pradesh and Odisha, which have also gone to the polls in the past month.

Exit polls suggested the BJP would sweep the elections and Mr Modi’s alliance had set a target of winning 400 seats, after winning 353 in the election in 2019.

They are staggered, such that a week or so passes between each round, and scattered all over the country, in a splotchy-looking map that the Election Commission of India has calibrated carefully.

Indian election 2024, voting phases Apr 14th May 7th 26th 13th 25th Jun 1st May 20th Ahead of the election, the outcome was in little doubt: Mr Modi’s BJP was strongly favoured to return to power. Over the past 40 years, when the party first contested an election, it has come to dominate national politics. Just as striking as the BJP ’s rise is Congress’s fall. The only previous time a party has broken the 400-seat mark in the Lok Sabha was in 1984, when Congress was propelled by a wave of sympathy after the assassination of Indira Gandhi, the prime minister, in October that year.

The ruling party’s strongholds are the north and west, India’s Hindi-speaking heartlands, where its Hindu-nationalist populism has proven popular. The approach has had far less resonance in the richer south, where the BJP has struggled against stronger regional competitors. There is also more hope for the opposition at the state level. The BJP holds only around a third of India’s more than 4,000 state assembly seats.

      "\n",
      "## Introduction\n",
      "The 2024 Indian general election, held to form the 18th Lok Sabha, was one of the most closely-watched political events globally. This research report compiles data from various credible sources to provide a comprehensive overview of the election results, voter behavior, political alliances, and the implications for India's political landscape.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Key Findings\n",
      "\n",
      "### Election Overview\n",
      "The general elections were held in seven phases between April 19 and June 1, 2024. The results were declared on June 4, 2024. A total of 543 parliamentary constituencies were contested. The voter turnout was approximately 67%, involving around 650 million voters.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Major Political Alliances\n",
      "1. **National Democratic Alliance (NDA)**: Led by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n",
      "2. **United Progressive Alliance (UPA)**: Led by the Indian National Congress (INC).\n",
      "3. **Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (INDIA)**: A coalition of over 30 parties aiming to present a formidable challenge to the BJP.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Election Results\n",
      "- **BJP and Allies**: Secured 293 seats, falling short of the 272 needed for a simple majority but still emerging as the largest coalition.\n",
      "- **Congress and Allies**: Won 234 seats, showing a significant improvement from previous elections.\n",
      "- **Others**: Various regional and smaller parties secured the remaining seats.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Detailed Seat Distribution\n",
      "- **BJP**: 240 seats\n",
      "- **INC**: 150 seats\n",
      "- **Other NDA allies**: 53 seats\n",
      "- **Other UPA allies**: 84 seats\n",
      "\n",
      "### Regional Performance\n",
      "- **North and West India**: The BJP maintained its stronghold, especially in the Hindi-speaking heartlands.\n",
      "- **South India**: The BJP struggled against regional parties, which held their ground.\n",
      "- **East India**: Mixed results with both BJP and regional parties winning significant seats.\n",
      "- **Northeast India**: Regional alliances played a crucial role, with BJP making inroads but not dominating.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Voter Behavior and Trends\n",
      "- **Urban vs. Rural**: Urban areas showed strong support for BJP, while rural regions were more divided, with significant support for regional parties.\n",
      "- **Youth Vote**: The youth vote was split, with a slight tilt towards BJP owing to their digital and social media campaigns.\n",
      "- **Women Voters**: Women showed increased participation, with a noticeable inclination towards UPA in urban areas.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Political Implications\n",
      "- **BJP**: Despite not achieving a full majority, BJP's performance solidifies its position as the dominant party in Indian politics. The party's reliance on allies, however, may lead to more coalition politics.\n",
      "- **Congress**: The improved performance provides a morale boost and sets the stage for future elections. The party's ability to form alliances was a key factor.\n",
      "- **Regional Parties**: Continued to play a significant role, especially in states like Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, and Andhra Pradesh. Their influence in national politics remains strong.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Analysis and Expert Opinions\n",
      "\n",
      "### Election Commission of India\n",
      "The Election Commission's meticulous planning and execution ensured a largely free and fair election process despite the logistical challenges posed by India's vast geography and large population.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Media Coverage\n",
      "- **The Economist**: Highlighted Modi's strategic campaign but noted the humbling result compared to BJP's expectations.\n",
      "- **BBC News**: Emphasized the comeback of opposition parties and the significance of regional alliances.\n",
      "- **Al Jazeera**: Focused on the electoral surprises and the role of voter demographics in shaping the results.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Political Analysts\n",
      "- **Milan Vaishnav, Carnegie Endowment**: Noted the changing dynamics of Indian politics with increased fragmentation and the rise of coalition governments.\n",
      "- **Sunetra Choudhury and Rahul Verma**: Discussed the strategic shifts and campaign tactics that influenced voter behavior.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "The 2024 Indian general election was a landmark event that showcased the vibrancy and complexity of Indian democracy. While the BJP emerged as the largest party, the results underscored the growing importance of coalition politics and regional parties. The election also highlighted the evolving voter demographics and the need for political parties to adapt to changing voter expectations.\n",
