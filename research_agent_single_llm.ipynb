      "Independent candidate Abdul Rasheed Sheikh, popularly known as engineer Rasheed, won the elections from Baramulla in northern Kashmir. He defeated former Chief Minister Omar Abdullah while lodged in jail since he was arrested under “anti-terror” law after being accused of money laundering.\n",
      "Hundreds of Kashmiri activists and leaders were arrested in the wake of the 2019 government decision to strip the Muslim-majority region’s special status. Prime Minister Modi said it was aimed at ending the armed rebellion, which erupted in the late 1980s.\n",
      "“Incarcerated former legislator Engineer Rashid’s massive win is an indication that Kashmir continues to be a ground for semi-separatist politics.” Zafar Choudhary, a political analyst based in the southern city of Jammu, told Al Jazeera.\n",
      "Along with Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti, also a former chief minister, has lost in their constituencies. However, candidates from Abdullah’s National Conference won in the Srinagar and Anantnag-Rajouri parliamentary constituencies.\n",
      "Political expert Sheikh Showkat Hussain told Al Jazeera that people have expressed their resentment against the BJP and its allies in Kashmir through their vote.\n",
      "“People have rejected BJP’s stance on Kashmir, it includes the abrogation of Article 370 decision,” he said referring to the constitutional safeguard that Modi government removed in 2019.\n",
      "In the southern city of Jammu, the BJP has retained its hold on the Udhampur and Jammu constituencies, but its vote share has come down drastically compared with the last elections.\n",
      "The outcome of the parliamentary elections is likely to have an effect on the assembly elections in Jammu and Kashmir slated to be held in September as per Supreme Court directions.\n",
      "The Ladakh result is being seen as a major setback for the BJP as the party received support when it carved out the region from Kashmir.\n",
      "“This is a defeat for BJP in Ladakh. This is people’s anger against the decision taken on August 5, 2019,” activist Sajad Kargili from Ladakh told Al Jazeera.\n",

      "The party’s candidate won in the district of Thrissur, which Congress had won in 2019.\n",
      "Congress was set to win 14 districts in the longtime left-leaning state, one fewer than five years ago.\n",
      "People stand in lines as they wait to cast their votes at a polling station during the second phase of the general election  in the southern state of Kerala, India on April 26. [Sivaram V/Reuters]\n",
      "live-orange4 Jun 2024 - 17:10 (17:10 GMT)Who are Modi’s allies in NDA coalition?Modi’s BJP party has won or are leading in 240 districts, putting them short the 272 seats needed for majority in the Lok Sabha, the lower house of the parliament.\n",
      "Factions of the far-right, Hindu ultranationalist party Shiv Sena – an ally of the BJP – were on track to win seven seats.\n",
      "That gives outsized influence to two regional parties, the Janata Dal-United JD(U) in the state of Bihar and the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh.\n",
      "Both parties recently broke of the opposition alliance, with the JD(U) accusing Congress of hoarding contested seats.\n",
      "The TDP is set to win 16 seats and the JD(U) is on track to win 12.\n",
      "live-orange4 Jun 2024 - 17:05 (17:05 GMT)So what went wrong for the BJP?The Bharatiya Janata Party failed to repeat its performance in the politically crucial state of Uttar Pradesh, which sends 80 representatives to the parliament. The BJP won 71 and 62 in the 2014 and 2019 elections respectively.\n",
      "The party has won 33 seats, bringing down the BJP tally to below the 272 magic figure needed to form a government. The BJP can form the next government with the help of its allies. It is is slated to win 241 seats.\n",
      "The BJP also lost support in agricultural regions in northern India, which saw protests against the Modi government. It suffered defeats in the state of Punjab, known as the bread basket of India, Rajasthan, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh mainly due to farmers’ unrest over lack of government support to the sector.\n",
      "The decision to topple the government in the western state of Maharashtra has probably cost the party dearly as it has suffered a major electoral setback in a state it dominated in the past decade.\n",
      "The overreliance on divisive politics led by Prime Minister Modi was avoidable, analysts say, adding that the governing party could have focused on the government’s achievements in the past 10 years. As a result, the opposition was able to set the agenda during the six weeks of campaigning.\n",
      "live-orange4 Jun 2024 - 16:55 (16:55 GMT)Coalition partners may put check on BJP: AnalystYashraj SharmaThe BJP is currently projected to only win 240 seats in Lok Sabha, short of the 272 needed for a majority. That means they are set to rely on NDA coalition partners for a majority.\n",
      "Those partners include Janata Dal-United, led by Nitish Kumar in the state of Bihar and the Telugu Desam Party, led by Chandrababu Naidu in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh. The TDP has won 15 seats and is leading on one seat, while the JD(U) has emerged victorious on 12 seats. Both the parties have also previously been in alliance with the Congress party.\n",
      "Over the past decade, under a majority BJP government, India has slid on several democratic indices amid accusations of a crackdown on dissent, political opposition, and media.\n",
      "With coalition partners to keep a check on the BJP, there “will be breathing space for the Indian civil society and the government’s critics”, Nilanjan Mukhopadhyay, a Modi biographer, told Al Jazeera.\n",
      "live-orange4 Jun 2024 - 16:40 (16:40 GMT)Why has BJP suffered such a setback in its Uttar Pradesh stronghold?The BJP was hoping to repeat its landslide victory in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, where the party won 71 and 62 seats in the 2014 and 2019 elections, respectively.\n",
      "But the country’s most populous state has caused the biggest shock of the 2024 elections, stopping the BJP from crossing the 272 mark, the number of seats needed to form a government. The BJP, which has won 33 seats, will now depend on allies to come back to power for a record third term.\n",
      "So what went wrong? Analysts said rising prices and record unemployment were major issues as Modi’s government struggled to address these challenges. Meanwhile, the ruling party devoted a lot of its energy to divisive issues that did not find traction among voters.\n",
      "Stray cattles were another issue after the state government’s 2017 decision to ban the slaughter of cattle. Farmers have complained that stray cattle destroy their crops.\n",
      "The opposition also mounted a major campaign on saving the constitution. It went big with the theme that the BJP would change the constitution if it got a supermajority. The BJP had initially set a target of winning more than 400 seats.\n",
      "The constitution, which guarantees reservations in jobs and legislatures for Dalits, also became a big talking point of the campaign. It created a fear among Dalits that the constitution was in danger.\n",
      "The Samajwadi Party, which is a major player in Uttar Pradesh, and the Congress party, which leads the INDIA opposition alliance, made social justice a major promise. This seem to have resonated with the voters, particularly from lower caste Hindus, amid rising income inequality and economic distress.\n",

      "This time around, Gandhi won two seats: Wayanad in the southern state of Kerala and Rae Bareli in Uttar Pradesh.\n",
      "“Thank you to the people of Wayanad and Rae Bareli for the huge support that you have given me,” he said in a post on X, adding he wishes he could represent both districts.\n",
      "He will have to resign from one of the seats. A by-election will be held for whichever seat he turns down.\n",

      "The Congress party managed to win a single seat in the Western state after a decade. The BJP had swept the state in 2014 and 2019 elections.\n",

      "Despite claiming victory, Kumar added, BJP leaders appeared more “chastened” than they had before the vote count.\n",
      "“What you see [in Modi’s speech] is an effort to try and pump up the crowd, to pump up the BJP supporters and say we will do better,” he said.\n",
      "“[He said] we achieved this, that and the other – the situation was very difficult in the last five years with a pandemic and yet we’ve done well. But the problem is the average person on the street, he was suffering as a result of the unemployment,” Kumar said.\n",

Instead, he said the election was a ringing endorsement for the BJP-led NDA coalition.\n",
      "“Since 1962, this is the first time that any government, after serving two terms, returns for a third term,” he said.\n",
      "He called the results “humbling and joyful”, adding, “to every voter of the country on this moment of victory, I want to bow down and salute them”.\n",
      "Modi pledged that he would advance India’s defence production, increase jobs for youth, raise exports and help farmers, among other things.\n",

      "Modi had increasingly focused on allegations the opposition planned to hand over the nation’s resources to Muslims, a tactic his critics dismissed as fearmongering. The opposition sought to corner Modi on his government’s economic track record.\n",
      "The BJP pitch carried a “tone of overconfidence”, said Nilanjan Mukhopadhyay, a Modi biographer, at a time when many in the Indian public were dealing with soaring prices, joblessness and income inequality so wide that it is now worse than during British colonial rule.\n",
      "The result was the “sleepwalking of the BJP into a disaster”, said Asim Ali, a political analyst and columnist.\n",

      "General elections were held in India from 19 April to 1 June 2024 in seven phases, to elect all 543 members of the Lok Sabha.[a] Votes were counted and the result was declared on 4 June to form the 18th Lok Sabha.[2][3] On 7 June 2024, Prime Minister Narendra Modi confirmed the support of 293 MPs to Droupadi Murmu, the president of India.[4] This marked Modi's third term as prime minister and his first time heading a coalition government,[5] with the Telugu Desam Party of Andhra Pradesh and Janata Dal (United) of Bihar emerging as two main allies.[6][7][8]\n",
      "More than 968 million people out of a population of 1.4 billion people were eligible to vote, equivalent to 70 percent of the total population.[9][10][11] 642 million voters participated in the election and 312 million of them were women, making it the highest ever participation by women voters.[12][13] This was the largest-ever election, surpassing the previous election, and lasted 44 days, second only to the 1951–52 Indian general election.  The legislative assembly elections in the states of Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Odisha, and Sikkim were held simultaneously with the general election, along with the by-elections for 25 constituencies in 12 legislative assemblies.\n",
      "Incumbent prime minister Narendra Modi, who completed a second term, ran for a third consecutive term after his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) had enjoyed an absolute majority—a minimum of 272 seats—in the 2019 and 2014 elections. The primary opposition was the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (INDIA), a coalition formed by the Indian National Congress (INC) and many regional parties in 2023. The election was criticised for lack of action on hate speeches by Modi's BJP,[14] reported electronic voting machine (EVM) malfunctioning,[15][16] and suppression of political opponents of the BJP.[17]\n",
      "Opinion surveys of mainstream media outlets projected a decisive victory for the BJP and its coalition, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA). However, the BJP won 240 seats, down from the 303 seats it had secured in 2019, and lost its singular majority in the Lok Sabha, whereas the overall NDA secured 293 of the house's 543 seats.[18] The INDIA coalition outperformed expectations, securing 234 seats, 99 of which were won by the Congress, garnering the party the official opposition status for the first time in 10 years.[19][20][21] Seven independents and ten candidates from non-aligned parties also won seats in the Lok Sabha.[22][23][24]\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Background\n",
      "Contemporary politics and previous elections\n",
      "India has a multi-party system with two major parties, namely the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Indian National Congress (INC), that dominate politics at the national level. The BJP has governed the country with Narendra Modi at the helm since 2014. The tenure of the 17th Lok Sabha is scheduled to end on 16 June 2024.[25] The previous general election was held in April–May 2019, after which the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), led by the BJP, formed the union government, with Modi continuing as Prime Minister.[26] The Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance, comprising of 26 opposition parties, was formed in 2023 to contest against the NDA in the elections.[27]\n",

      "Electoral system\n",
      "Main article: Elections in India\n",
      "Chief Election Commissioner Rajiv Kumar announced the schedule for the elections on 16 March 2024 \n",
      "Article 83 of the Constitution of India requires elections to the Lok Sabha to be held once every five years.[28] The 543 MPs are elected from single-member constituencies using first-past-the-post voting.[29] The 104th amendment to the constitution abolished the two seats that were reserved for the Anglo-Indian community.[30]\n",
      "Indian citizens who are 18 years or older, ordinary residents of the polling area of the constituency and registered to vote (name included in the electoral rolls), possess a valid voter identification card issued by the Election Commission of India or equivalent are eligible to vote.[31] People convicted of electoral or other offenses and prisoners, are barred from voting.[32] Indians holding foreign citizenship are not eligible to vote in India. There is no postal or online absentee voting in India; members of the Indian diaspora are required to travel back to their home constituencies in order to cast a ballot.[33]\n",
      "For the 2024 election, 968 million people were eligible to vote, an increase of about 150 million people from the 2019 election.[34] In Arunachal Pradesh, a polling station will be set up for the only registered voter in the village of Malogam, as electoral laws stipulate that voting booths need to be within two kilometres (1.2 mi) from any settlement.[35][36] A polling station was also set up inside the Gir Forest in Gujarat to cater for a single voter, a priest at a Hindu temple.[37] Polling stations were also set up inside a wildlife sanctuary in Kerala, in a shipping container in Gujarat, and 320 relief camps hosting nearly 59,000 people displaced during violence in Manipur.[38][39]\n",
      "In March 2024, the Supreme Court of India rejected a petition by the Congress party to end the usage of electronic voting machines (EVMs) and revert to paper ballots and manual counting, which was the system used in elections until the late 1990s, with the party citing risks of electoral fraud.[40] Nearly 5.5 million EVMs were utilized in more than one million polling stations with 15 million election workers and security personnel tasked with managing the conduct of the election.[41]\n",
      "For the first time, the Election Commission of India allowed voters with disabilities and those over the age of 85 to cast ballots from their homes.[42] In Telangana, voting in some areas was extended by an hour more to allow voters to come at a more convenient time.[43]\n",
      "\n",
      "Planning\n",
      "Key processes during a Lok Sabha election involved monitoring campaign expenditure, preventing the circulation of illicit goods, and ensuring adherence to the Model Code of Conduct. In the final 48 hours before voting, campaigns are ceased, and measures are implemented to maintain order and prevent disruptions. On polling day, strict rules are enforced to prevent undue influence and ensure a secure and free election process. After the elections, EVMs are sealed and stored under tight security with Booth Level Officers assisting throughout the process.[44]\n",

      "Unemployment took a centre stage in the election campaigns, with the opposition Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance criticising the BJP government's handling of the Indian economy for rising inflation, inequality and unemployment.[86] As a part of its separate youth manifesto, the Congress-led INDIA bloc promised to fill in the 3 million vacancies in government jobs and bring in the \"Right to Apprenticeship\", in which any diploma and degree holder up to the age of 25 can demand employment for one year and they will get a one-year salary of ₹100,000 for the term of the job.[87]\n",

      "The BJP prepared a pamphlet for the Ram Mandir Inauguration Programmes to connect with families across the nation. After the consecration of the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya, a new era of Hindu nationalistic sentiments have dominated the political sphere in India.[88][89] Modi kept a long-standing political pledge of the reconstruction of the Ram Mandir and was seen to have fulfilled the BJP's manifesto to the nation's Hindu population.[89] The Hindu nationalist ideology of Modi and the BJP has also garnered substantial support from Hindu community members.[90][91] At the same time, Bollywood productions have been released with themes supporting the Modi government's policies and Hindu nationalist ideologies.[92] In response to such concerns, BJP spokesperson Mmhonlumo Kikon acknowledged the existence of a \"level of threat perception\", but said that the party was trying to change that.[93]\n",
      "A major controversy was stirred when the opposition Congress Party and its leaders declined an invitation to the Ram Mandir consecration ceremony, saying that the event was politicised into a 'BJP-RSS event'.[94] Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said that the invitation was an opportunity for the Congress to 'reduce its sin', and that history would continue to judge it as 'anti-Hindu'.[95] The four Shankaracharyas also declined attending the event, stating that the ceremony was politicised as a campaign event at the half-built temple.[96][97]\n",
      "During a campaign rally in Rajasthan on 21 April, Narendra Modi accused the Congress party of prioritizing Muslim access to national wealth and planning to distribute resources among \"those who have more children\" and \"infiltrators\" once it was in power, which reflected stereotypes about Muslims reproducing in greater numbers and conspiracy theories pushed by the BJP that Muslims were planning to outnumber Hindus. Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge called Modi's remarks a panic-filled \"hate speech\" and a ploy to divert attention from the opposition outperforming the BJP during the first phase of the election, while officials in Rajasthan received complaints from the Azad Adhikar Sena and a non-profit organisation demanding Modi's arrest and for his campaign to be suspended.[98][99]\n",
      "A complaint letter by the Samvidhan Bacchao Nagrik Abhiyan (Save the Constitution Citizens' Campaign) organisation to the Election Commission of India, signed by over 17,400 people, alleged that Modi had violated the Model Code of Conduct and the Representation of the People Act, 1951 by making a speech \"aiming at not only appealing to 'communal feelings' but also instigating and aggravating hatred in the Hindus against Muslims\".[100][101]\n",

      "Electoral Bonds\n",
      "On 15 February 2024, the Supreme Court of India ruled that the Electoral Bond system of campaign financing that was introduced by the Modi government in 2017 which allowed individuals and companies to donate money to political parties anonymously and without limits was unconstitutional, saying that the process allowed donors to assert \"influence over policymaking\".[102] On 18 March, the court ordered the State Bank of India (SBI) to provide all records regarding the electoral bonds to the Election Commission of India by 21 March in order to match electoral donors with their recipients and rejected a plea by the Confederation of Indian Industry, the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry, and the Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India from divulging the identities of donors. Initial reports suggest that among the leading donors to political parties were some of India's largest firms such as Vedanta Limited, Bharti Airtel, RPSG Group and Essel Mining. It also found that the BJP was the recipient of nearly half of all recorded donations.[103]\n",
      "In total, the top five political parties in terms of electoral bonds received are the BJP, which received Rs 6,060.5 crore, the All India Trinamool Congress (TMC), which received Rs 1,609.5 crore, the Congress Party, with Rs 1,421.8 crore, the Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS), which received Rs 1,214.7 crore, and the Biju Janata Dal (BJD), which received Rs 775.5 crore.[104][105][106] The biggest buyer of electoral bonds was found to be Santiago Martin, the Tamil Nadu-based head of the lottery firm Future Gaming and Hotel Services Private Limited, who bought bonds worth 13.68 billion rupees ($163 million) between 2020 and 2024 and made donations to the TMC, the BJP, and the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), which rules Tamil Nadu. The biggest single donor to any political party was Megha Engineering and Infrastructure Limited (MEIL), a construction firm based in Hyderabad that bought electoral bonds worth over 12 billion rupees ($144 million) between 2019 and 2024 and made donations to the Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS), the BJP, and the Congress Party, who alternated in ruling Telangana during that time.[107]\n",
      "Some politicians from the opposition have termed Electoral Bonds a \"scam\" and an \"extortion racket\".[108][109][110] In response to allegations regarding the electoral bonds, BJP spokesperson Syed Zafar Islam denied that the party had done any wrongdoing and said that its electoral bonds were gained \"on merit\".[107] However, Indian political observers have reached the conclusion that either Indian businessmen have been regularly bribing their way out of trouble, or that the BJP-controlled government has been using government agencies to extort them. From the data released by the SBI, it was found that companies gave donations around the time they received major government contracts. Close to half of the top 30 corporate donors were facing investigations by government agencies around the time they purchased electoral bonds.[111][112][113]\n",

After being flagged by multiple users, the video was taken down less than 24 hours after its publication.[126] A similar video posted on X towards voters in Karnataka was also ordered taken down by the Electoral Commission and led to police opening cases against senior BJP leaders.[127]\n",

      "The Congress started a crowdfunding campaign known as Donate for Desh (Donate for the Country) ahead of the general elections. It formally launched the campaign's digital version on 18 December 2023 at a dedicated website. It claimed to be inspired from Mahatma Gandhi's Tilak Swaraj Fund (1920–21). The physical version of the campaign, which be done via door-to-door collection drives, was launched on 28 December.[150][151]\n",
      "The campaign received ₹1.45 crore (US$170,000) on its first day, with the top five states in amount of donations being Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, and Karnataka.[152]\n",
      "By the end of 2023, the campaign received around ₹9 crore (US$1.1 million), with 30% of the funds being collected from Telangana and Maharashtra alone.[153]\n",
      "The campaign had collected about ₹20 crore (US$2.4 million) according to the party when on 28 January, it rebranded its crowdfunding campaign to Donate for Nyay (Donate for Justice), in line with Rahul Gandhi's ongoing Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra.[154] The ensuing crowdfunding campaign collected four crores in 4 days.[155]\n",

      "Funding issues\n",
      "On 16 February 2024, the Congress Party alleged that the Income Tax Department (IT) ordered the freezing of bank accounts by the Congress Party containing 2.1 billion rupees ($25.3 million) as part of an ongoing legal dispute.[156] The Congress Party's treasurer Ajay Maken later added that tax authorities imposed a 2.1-billion rupee ($25 million) lien on 13 February, \"virtually sealed\" its bank accounts and confiscated 1.1 billion rupees ($14 million). The party's leader Rahul Gandhi complained that the restrictions had rendered the party unable to campaign properly, adding that \"Our entire financial identity has been erased.\" Gandhi also accused Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah of conducting a \"criminal action\" against the party, which the BJP denied. His mother and former Congress leader Sonia Gandhi also alleged that the tax issues are \"part of the systemic efforts to cripple\" the party. An appeal is currently pending in the Supreme Court.[157]\n",
      "According to the IT Department's official sources, it has recovered ₹135 crore from the Congress for breaking the legislation exempting political parties from paying taxes, rather than freezing the party's bank accounts as the opposition party had claimed.[158] The party received notices from the IT department again on 29 March asking it to pay ₹1,823.08 crore (US$218 million). The Congress accused the BJP of engaging in \"tax terrorism\" and alleged that the BJP is in serious violation of income-tax laws and that the IT department should raise a demand of ₹4,617.58 crore (US$553 million) crore from the BJP for such violations.[159]\n",

The yatra lasted until 1 March 2024 and covered 33 districts.[161][162] In Siwan on 23 February, Yadav termed the BJP \"a dustbin\" which takes in other parties that have become \"garbage\".[163][164]\n",

The Enforcement Directorate is also investigating four chief ministers not allied with the BJP on various charges, while investigations have been closed on former opposition politicians who have since joined the BJP. Hartosh Singh Bal, a journalist for the current affairs magazine The Caravan told Agence France-Presse that the move by government agencies indicated their behavior as \"handmaidens of the ruling party to cow down the political opposition\".[156]\n",
      "Following Kejriwal's arrest on 21 March over the liquor license scam charges, Delhi's finance minister Atishi Marlena Singh accused the BJP of orchestrating a \"political conspiracy\" against Kejriwal.[165] His arrest also led to clashes between party leaders, supporters and the police on 22 March.[166] Rahul Gandhi, reacting to Kejriwal's arrest, said that a \"scared dictator\" wants to create a \"dead democracy\", without naming anyone.[167] After he was released on bail and allowed to vote, Kejriwal urged citizens to vote \"vote against dictatorship\".[168] He then returned to prison as part of his bail conditions.[169]\n",
      "The BJP-led government has been known to use Enforcement Directorate raids to target opposition politicians critical of it, with 95% of cases registered being against opposition leaders.[170][171][172] Since 2014, 25 opposition leaders facing corruption charges have joined the BJP, with 23 of them having their inquiries closed or frozen after joining the ruling party.[173] This has led the Congress Party to compare the trend to a \"washing machine\" in one of its campaign videos.[126]\n",

      "Instances of EVM malfunctioning and removal of candidates belonging to the opposition were reported throughout the elections.[305] On 18 April, the Supreme Court asked the ECI to look into reported EVM malfunctioning in Kerala.[16] 150 EVMs were replaced in Assam after reported malfunctioning.[306] In Varanasi, about 33 nominations challenging Narendra Modi were rejected, of which 8 applicants claimed that the process was rigged in favour of the BJP.[17]\n",
      "On 4 June, former Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel said there was a discrepancy in EVM numbers while former Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav accused the administration of carrying out arrests of his party workers in order to stop them from counting votes.[307]\n",

      "Narendra Modi called the NDA's lead \"a historical feat in India's history\", while Congress party president Mallikarjun Kharge said the election was a \"moral and political loss\" for Modi and a \"win for democracy\" and the public.[325] In a speech to his supporters on 4 June, Modi said that the NDA would form a third consecutive government.[326] Following a meeting with other members of the NDA on 5 June, Modi was formally endorsed to become prime minister again.[327] On 7 June, he was selected as leader of the NDA[328] and was inaugurated as prime minister on 9 June.[329]  On 10 June, Modi unveiled his 71-member cabinet, of which the BJP took 61 portfolios, including foreign affairs, home affairs, finance and defence, while the Telugu Desam Party and Janata Dal (United) took two ministries each, with the rest going to other members of the NDA.[330] The BJP's Om Birla was reelected for a second term as Speaker of the Lok Sabha on 26 June.[331]\n",
      "Independent MPs from Sangli and Purnia Vishal Patil and Pappu Yadav, both of whom are primary members of the Congress party, extended their support to it after the election, effectively increasing the opposition alliance's tally to 236.[332][333][334] On 8 June, the leadership of the Congress Party unanimously nominated Rahul Gandhi to become Leader of the Opposition, a position which had been vacant since 2014.[335] He formally assumed the post on 25 June.[336]\n",

      "The benchmark BSE Sensex and Nifty50 indices hit intraday record highs and the Indian rupee strengthened after the exit polls were released. However, on the day results were announced, Indian stock markets crashed.[345] Rahul Gandhi subsequently called for an investigation, saying that Modi, Amit Shah and finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman had misled investors into buying stocks before the release of the election results on 4 June in anticipation of a landslide victory by the BJP.[346]\n",

Narendra Modi, India’s prime minister, claimed victory, after his Bharatiya Janata Party and its allies won 292 seats in the Lok Sabha, the lower house of Parliament (272 are needed to form a government). The opposition alliance led by the Congress party won 234 seats. The results are a humbling for Mr Modi.  Exit polls suggested the BJP would sweep the elections and Mr Modi’s alliance had set a target of winning 400 seats, after winning 353 in the election in 2019. The chart above shows the seat count by party, and the map at the bottom of this page shows the result in each seat.If you are interested in contests elsewhere, see our Trump/Biden poll tracker, our British election tracker and more at our election tracker hub.Indian elections take place over seven phases. They are staggered, such that a week or so passes between each round, and scattered all over the country, in a splotchy-looking map that the Election Commission of India has calibrated carefully. And no one will know who won any given seat until the results are announced on June 4th. Why draw out the voting like this? Getting from one part of the country to another takes time; some of India’s more than 1m polling stations are still extremely remote. A roving company of administrators, backed up by an enormous number of police and paramilitary forces, try to ensure a free and fair election. In wilder times the Election Commission was chiefly concerned with protecting ballot boxes from being stuffed or stolen, or candidates kidnapped. Today it is more focused on organising a fair and well-publicised vote.  Indian election 2024, voting phases Apr 14th May 7th 26th 13th 25th Jun 1st May 20th  Ahead of the election, the outcome was in little doubt: Mr Modi’s BJP was strongly favoured to return to power. Over the past 40 years, when the party first contested an election, it has come to dominate national politics. Just as striking as the BJP’s rise is Congress’s fall. The only previous time a party has broken the 400-seat mark in the Lok Sabha was in 1984, when Congress was propelled by a wave of sympathy after the assassination of Indira Gandhi, the prime minister, in October that year. That helped it win nearly half of the vote. This year it may struggle to win more than a fifth. To put up a stronger fight, it has teamed up with more than 30 other parties in the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (INDIA).Read more of our coverage of the Indian election, or sign up to Essential India, our free weekly newsletter.For the opposition, the proposition of toppling the BJP may seem daunting. The ruling party’s strongholds are the north and west, India’s Hindi-speaking heartlands, where its Hindu-nationalist populism has proven popular. The approach has had far less resonance in the richer south, where the BJP has struggled against stronger regional competitors. There is also more hope for the opposition at the state level. The BJP holds only around a third of India’s more than 4,000 state assembly seats. It has suffered defeats to smaller, regional parties, including in Andhra Pradesh and Odisha, which have also gone to the polls in the past month.We will populate the map below with the latest results, seat by seat, once they are declared.  ■Winning party in each seat  BJP  Allies  Congress   Allies   Other    \n",

      "With over 986 million registered voters, India is the world's largest democracy. India will hold elections this spring, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking a third term. Given the recent progress achieved in the U.S.-India bilateral relationship, and with the U.S. elections around the corner too, it is important to assess how this relationship will be further shaped, and impact global geopolitics. The India Chair at CSIS will provide a comprehensive analysis of the issues at stake during the elections, and their potential impact on key areas such as defense, economic cooperation, center-state relations, energy, and more.\n",

It analyzes and seeks to improve international efforts to reduce democratic backsliding, mitigate conflict and violence, overcome political polarization, promote gender equality, and advance pro-democratic uses of new technologies.Learn Moreprogram South AsiaThe South Asia Program informs policy debates relating to the region’s security, economy, and political development. From strategic competition in the Indo-Pacific to India’s internal dynamics and U.S. engagement with the region, the program offers in-depth, rigorous research and analysis on South Asia’s most critical challenges.Learn Moreproject India Elects 2024India Elects 2024 presents sober, data-driven research and analysis from the world’s best young India scholars on the key drivers animating this massive democratic exercise. The initiative takes readers beyond the horse race, focusing on deeper questions about India’s political economy.Learn MoreNow that voters in five states have rendered their judgments in a clutch of recently concluded state assembly elections, the eyes of 1.4 billion Indians—and those observing from abroad—turn to the country’s general elections, expected to be held over several weeks in April–May 2024.\n",
      "The results of the December 3 state polls provided a big boost to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The party swept elections in the Hindi belt states of Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, and Rajasthan. The lone victory for the opposition Indian National Congress (INC, also known as the Congress Party) came in the southern state of Telangana. Neither the BJP nor the Congress Party figured prominently in the Mizoram battle.\n",
      "These results confirm what is already common knowledge: as far as the 2024 parliamentary elections are concerned, the BJP remains firmly in pole position. This advantage is principally driven by Modi’s enduring popularity. According to Morning Consult, which tracks the weekly approval ratings of more than twenty democratically elected world leaders, 78 percent of Indians surveyed in late November approved of Modi’s job performance. Modi’s net approval (calculated as the share of respondents who approve of his performance minus those who disapprove) is a stunning +60. The second-most-popular leader on the list is Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, whose net rating is “only” +30. It is even more remarkable that Modi’s approval has been remarkably consistent since August 2019, the date that data were first available.1\n",
      "Domestic opinion polls confirm that Modi’s popularity remains intact and that this continues to fuel his party’s dominance. The biannual Mood of the Nation poll from India Today has consistently shown, including as recently as August 2023, that the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) would handily capture a majority of seats in the Lok Sabha, even if its majority reduces compared to its 2019 tally (when it notched 353 seats, shown in figure 1).\n",
      " \n",
      "However, elections are popular demonstrations of the will of the electorate; they are not preordained coronations. Past experience—not least the previous NDA government’s surprise upset at the hands of the Congress Party–led United Progressive Alliance in 2004—suggests that Indian voters do not thoughtlessly conform to the conventional wisdom du jour. As the road to 2024 begins, five issues are worth watching: the waning predictive power of state elections, the challenge of opposition coordination, the battle for backward castes, the arms race of competitive welfarism, and the emergence of foreign policy as a mass issue.\n",
      "Limits of State Election Results\n",
      "The first issue to keep in mind is the limited predictive power of the recent state assembly polls. While it would be churlish to deny the BJP its celebration, it would be shortsighted for the party to believe that these results mechanically predict how voters in these five states will behave in next year’s general elections.\n",
      "In an earlier era of Indian politics, scholars detected an unmistakable relationship between state and national elections. As the political scientist Nirmala Ravishankar found, candidates that state ruling parties put forward in national elections fared well when the elections occurred early in the state government’s term. Conversely, candidates nominated by state ruling parties whose respective governments were deep into their tenure were punished in national elections.\n",
      " \n",
      "This correlation has broken down in recent years. As figure 2 demonstrates, the Congress Party swept the December 2018 assembly elections in Chhattisgarh and bested the BJP in both Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan. But this advantage proved short-lived. In the parliamentary result (disaggregated by assembly constituency segments), the BJP dominated over the Congress Party in all three states in the Lok Sabha elections less than six months later.2 In the 2018 Telangana state polls, the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS)—later rechristened the Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS)—won three out of every four seats, but the party could not replicate this achievement in the 2019 elections, where the Congress Party and the BJP collectively won seven of seventeen parliamentary seats.\n",
      "However, there is reason to believe that this correlation could be stronger in 2024 than in years past. Modi’s unparalleled popularity means that electorates have an extra incentive to back the BJP in national elections because doing so reinforces his position.\n",
      "Challenge of Opposition Coordination\n",
      "In 2014 and 2019, the BJP was aided in its quest to attain a single-party majority in Parliament by a fragmented opposition. In many constituencies, the BJP was facing off against not a unified opposition but several opposition parties competing with one another as much as they were battling the BJP. The inevitable result was a fracturing of the opposition vote. In India’s first-past-the-post elections, a candidate need not capture a majority of votes to win their constituency; they simply need more votes than the runner-up.\n",
      "The opposition, after two successive electoral defeats in Parliament, seems determined to learn from past failures. In July, more than two dozen opposition parties announced the creation of a new opposition formation, the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (or INDIA for short). The alliance is a hodgepodge, ranging from the Congress Party, which has a pan-Indian footprint, to the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (the ruling party in Tamil Nadu) and Communist parties of all stripes. The opposition alliance has talked a good game about collectively taking on the BJP, but it faces an uphill climb on at least three counts.\n",
      "First, the alliance must agree on a common platform that transcends a reflexive opposition to the Modi-led BJP. The BJP alliance earned 45 percent of the vote in the 2019 election, suggesting that more than half of the country did not support it. While their common anti-BJP position creates a floor for the opposition, the INDIA coalition must also offer an alternative vision for governing that sufficiently distinguishes it from the BJP.\n",
      "Second, at present, the INDIA bloc is leaderless. This places it at a distinct disadvantage to the ruling alliance, which boasts a larger-than-life leader in Modi. While the opposition is factually correct in stating that India is a parliamentary democracy in which the eventual prime minister will be chosen by the party (or coalition) that constitutes a majority in the Lok Sabha, this ignores the fact that Modi has successfully presidentialized the system over the past decade. In the face of a popular incumbent, the INDIA coalition risks being dismissed unless a leader emerges who offers a counterpoint to Modi.\n",
      "Finally, the opposition has yet to negotiate a seat-sharing agreement. If it is to truly fight as a unified front, INDIA’s constituent parties must voluntarily forego contesting seats they feel they “own” in order to make way for partners. This is easier said than done. In many states, like Punjab, constituent parties like the Congress Party and the Aam Aadmi Party are bitter opponents. In West Bengal, the Congress Party and the Left Front have fought together to displace Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee of the Trinamool Congress, yet now they must join hands.\n",
      "Even if alliance members agree to let bygones be bygones, coalition arithmetic does not automatically generate coalition chemistry. Take the example of Uttar Pradesh in the 2019 elections. There, the two foremost regional parties—the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and the Samajwadi Party (SP), long at loggerheads—joined forces to keep the BJP out of power. Notwithstanding this grand coalition, the BJP alliance earned 51 percent of the vote and bagged sixty-four (of eighty total) seats, while the BSP-SP alliance won 39 percent of the vote but just fifteen seats.3\n",
      "On paper, the opposition alliance had arithmetic in its favor; the SP and BSP jointly earned 42 percent of the vote in 2014—the same share as the BJP. But, in 2019, arithmetic on paper was not a substitute for the lack of chemistry in practice.\n",
      "Breaking Down Backward Castes\n",
      "The third factor to consider is the battle over the allegiance of the Other Backward Classes (OBCs), the largest single voter bloc in India, likely accounting for more than 40 percent of the population. The electoral transformation of the BJP under Modi owes its success, in large measure, to the party’s ability to attract OBCs into its fold—snatching key voters away from the Congress Party and from the so-called Mandal parties in northern India, which mobilized on the basis of empowering backward castes.4 Hindi belt parties, like the Janata Dal (United) and Rashtriya Janata Dal in Bihar and the Samajwadi Party (SP) of Uttar Pradesh, shot to popularity thanks to their ability to cater to large segments of the OBC vote—until Modi’s arrival, that is. According to data collected by the Lokniti Programme for Comparative Democracy at the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies and analyzed by Rahul Verma, in the 2009 election the BJP captured 22 percent of the OBC vote (see figure 3). In 2014, under Modi (who happens to hail from the OBCs), the BJP made large inroads among this community.\n",
      "\n",
      "In particular, the BJP positioned itself as the champion of jatis (subcastes) located among the lower rungs of the OBC community. These deprived groups, referred to as Extremely Backward Classes (EBCs) or Lower OBCs, did not necessarily reap the benefits promised by the Mandal mobilization, with most of the visible benefits accruing to a handful of dominant jatis. The BJP’s bet paid off big in 2014. While the party captured 30 percent of the OBC vote, it earned 43 percent of the EBC vote. In 2019, it increased its gains among both groups, winning 41 percent of the OBC vote and 48 percent of the EBC vote. The share of the backward vote flowing to the Congress Party and once-dominant regional parties declined precipitously in turn.\n",
      "Down but not out, the Mandal parties plotted their revenge. The charge has been led by Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, an erstwhile political ally of the BJP who championed the cause of a comprehensive caste census in his state, a politically contentious maneuver meant to spotlight the pervasive underrepresentation of OBCs.5 Bihar released the results of this first-of-a-kind census in October, revealing that OBCs made up 63 percent of the state’s population. The finding fueled fresh demands for proportional reservations in government jobs.\n",
      "The issues surfaced by the caste census have placed the BJP on the back foot, with the opposition exploiting a rare opportunity to define the political narrative ahead of 2024, especially in heartland states. But the BJP does not lack cards to play. Chief among them is the fate of the Rohini Commission, a government committee set up to propose the creation of official subcategories within the OBC grouping. This task of subcategorization is crucial because it provides a blueprint for allocating OBC reservations among the hundreds of communities that fall within this larger umbrella grouping—in essence, creating subquotas within the larger quota.\n",
      "The commission submitted its final report in August, but the contents remain under wraps. If the government publishes the report and announces its intent to implement the committee’s recommendations, it could take the wind out of the sails of the opposition on this score. But there are also clear downsides to this course of action: divvying up OBC reservations will create winners as well as losers within this large, heterogeneous group, increasing disaffection among dominant OBC groups. Furthermore, highlighting the issue of reservations could raise the ire of the BJP’s upper-caste supporters, who worry about the adverse consequences of an ever-expanding thicket of affirmative action schemes in which they do not figure.\n",
      "Competitive Welfarism\n",
      "A fourth factor shaping the 2024 fight is the impact of welfare schemes on voting behavior. As former chief economic adviser Arvind Subramanian has noted, a critical pillar of the Modi government’s economic program consists of what he has termed “new welfarism,” in which the government has ramped up investments in the public distribution of private goods such as gas cylinders (a clean source of cooking fuel), toilets, bank accounts, and electricity connections.\n",
      "Data from successive waves of the National Family Health Survey (NFHS) demonstrate that access to a range of household goods has risen dramatically (see table 1), with the rate of penetration rising significantly post-2014. This welfare push has been coupled with the government’s embrace of direct cash transfers, which have funneled government benefits directly into household bank accounts while cutting out leaky intermediaries.\n",

      "As Suyash Rai has shown, the expansion in cash transfers and in-kind assistance has been staggering. According to his calculations, the central government transferred 73.7 billion rupees in cash ($1.2 billion) to about 108 million beneficiaries in 2013­–2014. In 2019–2020, it channeled 2.4 trillion rupees ($34 billion) in cash to more than 700 million beneficiaries using its direct benefits transfer platforms, alongside an additional 1.4 trillion rupees ($20 billion) worth of in-kind benefits. These benefits surged further on account of the pandemic.6\n",
      "Although the conventional narrative holds that the BJP fought—and won—the 2019 election on the back of nationalism induced by a national security crisis involving Pakistan, economics had a distinct role to play. Indeed, in the months leading up to the poll, the central government announced an annual cash transfer of 6,000 rupees ($86) to every farming household under a new scheme meant to alleviate symptoms of rural distress. This scheme transferred cash directly into the bank accounts of some of the country’s most underprivileged households.\n",
      "Survey evidence suggests that these investments engendered political returns. One analysis of the 2019 general election found that voters who received benefits under central government schemes involving cooking gas, bank accounts, and housing were more likely to support the BJP. However, it is also true that some welfare beneficiaries, namely pensioners and participants in a national rural employment guarantee scheme, were more inclined to vote for non-BJP parties.\n",
      "In the recently concluded assembly elections, parties of all stripes made lavish promises of transfers if brought to power. For instance, the BJP announced a 150,000-rupee cash transfer to every girl child in Mizoram and an annual 12,000-rupee payment for married women in Chhattisgarh if it were brought to power (amounting to $1,800 and $144, respectively). To entice voters in Telangana, the BRS promised 100,000 rupees ($1,200) to the families of low-income and Muslim brides. In Rajasthan, the state Congress Party promised 10,000 rupees ($120) to every woman head of household, tacking on a commitment to provide women with smartphones and free internet.\n",
      "The opposition has clearly homed in on the BJP’s welfare plank and wants to ensure it fights fire with fire, blunting the tight association between the prime minister and dozens of central welfare schemes. Not to be outflanked, the Modi government recently announced the extension of a pandemic-era scheme to provide free food grains to 800 million citizens for an additional five years. While lavish welfare promises do not guarantee victory—evidenced by the recent state results—the BJP will likely look to further innovate in this domain ahead of 2024, given the opposition’s fierce response to the party’s welfare gambit.\n",
      "Foreign Policy for the Masses\n",
      "A final factor informing the 2024 elections is harder to pin down—India’s evolving role in the world. Traditionally, political scientists studying India have distinguished between “elite” and “mass” issues. Elite issues concern subjects like foreign policy, national security, and trade policy, while mass issues pertain to matters like inflation, jobs/employment, and welfare benefits, issues that have a visceral impact on ordinary lives.\n",
      "Modi has arguably broken the invisible barrier between these two categories. In February 2019, just months before voting began, a suicide bomber attacked a convoy of Indian paramilitary troops in Jammu and Kashmir, killing forty Indian personnel. The ensuing crisis, punctuated by India’s retaliatory strikes on alleged terrorist training camps in Pakistan, helped to generate a nationalist fervor that Modi skillfully tapped into and owned on the campaign trail.\n",
      "It was hardly the first time an Indian general election took place in close proximity to a security crisis. The infamous 26/11 attacks in Mumbai occurred months before the 2009 election, and the 1999 Kargil War between India and Pakistan transpired just ahead of that year’s general election. But, in both cases, there is scant hard evidence that national security had a measurable impact on the election outcome. In 2019, polling data suggested that the crisis bolstered the BJP’s fortunes, helping to displace more quotidian concerns about the economy.\n",
      "But the impact of foreign policy on voter behavior cannot necessarily be reduced to contingencies alone. There is a widespread perception that Modi has elevated India’s status on the global stage, ensuring that the country enjoys a seat at the global high table. The government’s yearlong, high-voltage marketing campaign celebrating its inaugural G20 presidency serves as recognition that the way India is perceived globally is a matter of domestic political salience.\n",
      "As Rohan Mukherjee has noted, rising powers like India care deeply about their status in the global hierarchy of powers. While India has long emphasized its moral exceptionalism and civilizational greatness, Indians do not always believe that non-Indians share their perceptions of their country’s global significance. The Modi government has worked overtime to propagate the idea that India has transitioned from being a “balancing” power to a “leading” one. Today, it is not uncommon for voters to remark that Modi has “put India on the map.”\n",
      "The opposition is at a disadvantage here. For starters, it lacks the agenda-setting power incumbency affords. And its attempts to critique the government also risk backfiring if voters believe it is actively rooting against the country. As Prashant Jha has observed, the opposition has repeatedly shifted the goalposts when scrutinizing the government’s foreign policy. For instance, the opposition hammered the government when it looked like it would fail to reach consensus on a G20 leaders’ declaration in September. When it eventually did, the opposition claimed that the government only succeeded by making critical concessions that watered the text down.\n",
      "Conclusion\n",
      "As the battle for 2024 begins in earnest, the incumbent BJP undeniably maintains the upper hand. It is home to India’s most popular leader, most formidable political organization, and most savvy marketing machinery. After disappointing state election results, the opposition is forced to regroup. Rhetorically, its leaders have agreed to a ceasefire that allows for collective action against an existential threat. Even the Congress Party, which has been hampered by charges of dynasty and nepotism, has projected a leader whose last name—after a long time—is not Gandhi. The question is whether the disparate opposition groups can develop a forward-looking political narrative that is simultaneously cogent and flexible. The opposition has a steep hill to climb, and time is not working in its favor.\n",

      "5 While the Census of India regularly collects data on the population of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, two historically disadvantaged groups that enjoy constitutionally protected reservations, the government has not undertaken a detailed enumeration of all caste groups since 1831. The issue has long been viewed as politically explosive given what it might reveal about the imbalance between the population and the demography of economic, social, and political realities in the country.\n",

A rapid transformation in social context and reality, rising number of political parties, changing dynamics and demands of coalitions and alliances, frequent elections and bye-elections, increase in number of eligible voters and continuous updating of electoral rolls have led to new challenges for election management bodies of today.Systematic Voters’ Education and Electoral ParticipationSystematic Voters’ Education and Electoral Participation program, better known as SVEEP, is the flagship program of the Election Commission of India for voter education, spreading voter awareness and promoting voter literacy in India. Since 2009, we have been working towards preparing India’s electors and equipping them with basic knowledge related to the electoral process.Election Commission of IndiaThe Election Commission of India is an autonomous constitutional authority responsible for administering election processes in India. The body administers elections to the Lok Sabha, Rajya Sabha, State Legislative Assemblies in India, and the offices of the President and Vice President in the country.Nirvachan Sadan, Ashoka Road, New Delhi 110001Quick LinksAbout ECIOfficers DirectoryContact UsPublic GrievanceRTI OnlineeOfficeApply for Voter CardSVEEPService Voter PortalDownload cVIGILCandidate AffidavitsInternational Cooperation India A-WEB CentreVoiceNet MCC CasesPolitical Parties Registration ECI Apps Links© Copyright Election Commission of India 2024| V 1.0\u001b[0m"
